/**
 * A constraint the models contact region forces, acting between two bodies. A ContactConstraint acts 
 * like any other constraint/joint, for instance {@link BallInSocketJoint}. ContactConstraint uses one ore more
 * {@link ContactGenerator} instances to supply contact points and contact normals of the involved geometries. 
 * When two bodies are subject to a contact constraint, a ContactGenerator for each interacting geometry pair is required. 
 * Determining and instantiating these ContactGenerators should be handled by the simulator itself, however, one can create new 
 * and possibly optimised ContactGenerators for certain geometry pairs. A trivial example would be a ContactGenerator
 * for the Sphere-Sphere case, which is already implemented in Jinngine, see ({@link SphereContactGenerator}).
